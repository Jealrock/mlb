# Exercises 

1. Machine learning is programming technique to write algorithms that can learn from data to perform specified actions.
2. Problems that require many hand written rules to be success, complex problems where no good solution using a traditional approach, fluctuating environments, problems with a large amounts of data
3. Labeled training set - is dataset that has labels(classes) for each record.
4. Classification, Regression
5. Clustering, Visualization, Dimensionality Reduction.
6. Reinforcement learning.
7. Clustering
8. Supervised learning problem
9. Online learning system is system which can learn "on fly", when data comes to algorithm.
10. Out-of-core learning - is a ML technique to load parts of the huge data, cuz that data cannot fit into machine memory directly
11. Instance-based algorithms
12. Model parameters - parameters that are learned. Hyperparameters - parameters that we tune to make algorithm better.
13. They search for functions that are best describe relations between datapoints.  Predict, compute error, optimize model parameters. By apply learned parameters to unknown data.
14. Quality of Data, Overfitting, Underfitting
15. Model is overfitting. Use regularization, get more training data, reduce number of features
16. Test set - is dataset which used to compare predicted output and real output. It used to compute accuracy and possibly improve it later.
17. To test what is the actual best hyperparamets is.
18. Model can perform poorly on unknown data. 
19. Cross-validation - is a technique to split training set into subsets and then train each model on various combination of this subsets.
